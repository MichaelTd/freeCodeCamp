<!--
  Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/KzXQgy/.
  Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
  User Story: I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
  User Story: My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
  User Story: I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.
  Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.
  When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.
  You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
