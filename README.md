#### [02-personal-portfolio-page](http://codepen.io/TdMichael/full/pNdVbg/)

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/YqLyXB/.
Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.
User Story: I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
User Story: I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
User Story: I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)
User Story: I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.
Don't worry if you don't have anything to showcase on your portfolio yet - you will build several apps on the next few CodePen challenges, and can come back and update your portfolio later.
There are many great portfolio templates out there already. However, you should consider building your portfolio page as much as you can from the ground up. Using Bootstrap can help make this process much easier for you.
Note that CodePen.io overrides the Window.open() function, so if you want to open windows using jQuery, you will need to target invisible anchor elements like this one: <a target='_blank'>.
Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.
When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.

#### [06-twitch.tv-json-api](http://codepen.io/TdMichael/full/pRWbew/)

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/.
Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
User Story: I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.
Hint: See an example call to Twitch.tv's JSONP API at http://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/use-the-twitchtv-json-api/19541.
Hint: The relevant documentation about this API call is here: https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/v3_resources/streams.md#get-streamschannel.
Hint: Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream: ["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]
UPDATE: Due to a change in conditions on API usage explained here Twitch.tv now requires an API key, but we've built a workaround. Use https://wind-bow.gomix.me/twitch-api instead of twitch's API base URL (i.e. https://api.twitch.tv/kraken ) and you'll still be able to get account information, without needing to sign up for an API key.
