# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects: Caesars Cipher

One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a <code>Caesar cipher</code>, also known as a <code>shift cipher</code>. In a <code>shift cipher</code> the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' ↔ 'N', 'B' ↔ 'O' and so on.

Write a function which takes a [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.

Remember to use [Read-Search-Ask](http://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck/19514) if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.


``` js
function rot13(str) {
  var rotCharArray = [];
  var regEx = /[A-Z]/ ;
  str = str.split("");
  for (var x in str) {
    if (regEx.test(str[x])) {
      rotCharArray.push((str[x].charCodeAt() - 65 + 13) % 26 + 65);
    } else {
      rotCharArray.push(str[x].charCodeAt());
    }
  }
  str = String.fromCharCode.apply(String, rotCharArray);
  return str;
}

// Change the inputs below to test
rot13("SERR PBQR PNZC");
```
