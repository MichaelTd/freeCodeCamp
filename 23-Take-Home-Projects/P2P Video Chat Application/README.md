<h1>Take Home Projects - P2P Video Chat Application</h1>

* Objective: Build a ```Glitch``` app that is functionally similar to this: ```https://grove-voice.glitch.me```.
* Fulfill the below ```user stories```. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
* User Story: Upon arriving, the browser will prompt me to access my camera and microphone.
* User Story: After I give it permission, I am prompted to type in a room name.
* User Story: Once I type in the room name, a room will be created if no room of that name existed before.
* User Story: A friend of mine can subsequently go to the same website, type in the same room I entered, and join the same room, then enter into a video chat with me.
* User Story: If I type in a room name, and there are already two people in that room, I get a notification that the room is full.
* User Story: Anyone can create or join any room. And there can be any number of rooms, but all of them must have unique names.
* User Story: I can choose to not permit the site to access my microphone and webcam. If I choose not to do this, if some other driver problem occurs, I see an error message saying these are required.
* User Story: When I choose to cancel the room name input step, or if I type in no name, or just spaces, it should again ask me again to type in a valid room name.
* User Story: If one of the two people in the room get disconnected, they can reconnect to the same room and continue chatting.
* Remember to use ```Read-Search-Ask``` if you get stuck.
* When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your Glitch App.
* You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
