<!--

  Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/JXrLLE/.
  Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
  User Story: I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.
  User Story: I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.
  Hint: You don't need to interpret Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked
  Note: If you want to use the React JSX syntax, you need to enable 'Babel' as a preprocessor
  Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.
  When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.
  You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
