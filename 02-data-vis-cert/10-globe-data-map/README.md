Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/mVEJag.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

* User Story: I can see where all Meteorites landed on a world map.
* User Story: I can tell the relative size of the meteorite, just by looking at the way it's represented on the map.
* User Story: I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.

* Hint: Here's a dataset you can use to build this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/meteorite-strike-data.json

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
