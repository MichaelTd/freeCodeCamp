    Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/ONxvaa/.
    Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
    User Story: I can see performance time visualized in a scatterplot graph.
    User Story: I can mouse over a plot to see a tooltip with additional details.
    Hint: Here's a dataset you can use to build this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/cyclist-data.json
    Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.
    When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.
    You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
